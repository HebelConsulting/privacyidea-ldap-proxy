# DN and password of the service account for the LDAP backend which is used to forward, e.g., search requests
# or to lookup the User DN in case the "lookup" user mapping strategy is used.

# If this is set to `true`, the LDAP proxy will send a bind request using the credentials of the service

# in the context of the service account.

# If this is set to `true`, the LDAP proxy will forward search requests to the LDAP backend.
# Mostly useful in conjunction with `bind-service-account`: If both are set to `true`, applications
# may issue search operations after a successful user authentiation.
# If `bind-service-account` is set to false, but `allow-search` is set to true, only the DNs
# in `passthrough-binds` will be able to issue search requests.

[user-mapping]
# This setting determines the strategy the LDAP proxy uses to determine the username that is sent to privacyIDEA
# from an incoming bind request's DN. There are currently two strategies:
# (1) "lookup": Processing an incoming user bind request, the LDAP proxy connects to the LDAP backend
# using the service account credentials (see above), looks up the user entry using the given DN and retrieves
# the value of a specific attribute (given in the "attribute" setting), which is subsequently used to authenticate
# the user against privacyIDEA
strategy = lookup
attribute = sAMAccountName
# (2) "match": Processing an incoming user bind request, the LDAP proxy extracts the username directly from the
# user DN. For that, it expects a setting "pattern", a regular expression pattern containing one group, the username.
#strategy = match
#pattern = "cn=([^,]+),cn=users,dc=test,dc=local"

[bind-cache]
# If this setting is enabled, successful user bind requests are added to a so-called "bind cache" in which
# they are kept for a specified time. During that time, incoming bind requests using the same credentials
# are internally replaced with bind requests using the service account credentials.
# The timeout is specified in seconds.
# This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.
